<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="lettre">N</span>O apology is made for bringing this volume before the public. Several
of the poems it contains were mere attempts to relieve the monotonous
routine of college life; many of them were written under foreign skies,
and this will account for that lack of national spirit which the title
of the volume might seem to imply. They have all been written hastily,
and with frequent interruptions, so that no time was left for refining
or amplifying. These remarks are not made to forestall criticism. Those
who look with a jealous eye to the honor of English literature, are
bound to pass what judgment they please upon every intruder into the
groves of Parnassus, regardless of any extenuating circumstances which
may be brought forth by way of palliation.</p>

<p>The dearth of national literature in Canada is to be deplored; and
whatever may have a tendency to stimulate activity in this line ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi"></a>{vi}</span>
not to be discouraged. The history of Canada has a poetic background.
Our people are by nature inclined to literature, as may be seen from the
high character of our home journals and from the large importation of
foreign books and magazines. Yet our national literature is meagre,
compared with that of other countries whose advantages have not been
superior to our own. Are not the pearly whiteness of our skies, the
placid loveliness of our lakes, the lonely majesty of our forests, as
well as the heroic struggles of our ancestors for the flag which they so
dearly loved, fit themes for poetic inspiration and for minstrel
reverie? It is true that we look to the Mother Country for our models;
but did not the Greek colonies produce a literature worthy to be
compared to that of Athens in her glory?</p>

<p>It is hoped that these remarks may not appear presumptuous; and as the
prisoner whose case is hopeless appeals to the mercy of the court in
order to ameliorate his condition, so the writer of these verses lays
aside his pen, promising to impose no further upon public sentiment.</p>

<span class="i0">A frog dwelt once upon a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far up within the northern clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas pleasant sure, when Summer threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er wood and lake and mountain blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a>{80}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fairy mantle; then the frog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting loud in many a bog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang siren songs in brake and bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as would fairly put to blush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fill, good faith, with envious rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The modern artist of the stage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well he might, the pesky elf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could even understand himself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as his voice still louder rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He understood the words he sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang, and leaping sang so clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very breezes paused to hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang till even the Echoes tired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear his songs no more aspired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why dilate upon this song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or why a tedious tale prolong?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Winter raised his elfin wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog retired to his pond;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was hushed, the winds that kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The placid lake his ditties missed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight in a tempest rage they flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And colder, wilder, louder blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Summer could no more endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled to southern climes secure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a>{81}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when cold Winter, tired grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would drop his wand a moment down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That self-same instant you might hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog’s shrill voice pipe loud and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Winds delighted sank again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gently swept the barren plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Summer, stirred by some strange force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight to the Northland took her course.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h4>CANTO II.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But once upon a certain time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere Winter visited that clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two idle geese were babbling by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little recked the frog was nigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They talked of climes so far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Summer holds eternal sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They talked of pearly skies serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woods forever robed in green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sunny ponds and fairy bogs,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paradise of singing frogs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then talked they of their journey thither,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed that they might have fair weather.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The frog all meekly sat the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then deigned to ask with winning smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82"></a>{82}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While visions of those tempting skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floated before his dazzled eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Where is that land, most potent bird?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of it, good faith, I’ve never heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray, let me follow, when once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You bend your course to that fair shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Winter never dare intrude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cast his spell of solitude.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At this the geese laughed loud and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hissing laugh that checked the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog had formed deep in his throat,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That song died in one gurgling note.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the elder of the birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addressed the frog the following words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thou silly elf, pray understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis many a league unto that land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should’st thou e’er presume to go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By single jumps and hops so slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, sure old age would overtake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee ere thou’d reach the fairy brake.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At this the frog at once began:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I’ve hit upon a novel plan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ll pluck some grass from yonder slope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And firmly twist it in a rope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a>{83}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twill do, I think, with single fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at each end you may take hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will grasp the middle tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A goose at both my left and right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ll cleave the upper air so light.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The frog scarce finished ere ’twould seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The geese consented to the scheme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They both affirmed with one accord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wisdom they had never heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fitting the action to the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They soon were sailing through the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound for the southern paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog swung on the grassy rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did not deign his mouth to ope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They travelled over many a rood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bush and brake and solitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length a farmer, half amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spied them aloft in mid-air raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much he wondered as he gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud the wise device he praised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asked whose wisdom ’twas had planned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous scheme his vision scanned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog, in whose own estimation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Centred the wisdom of creation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84"></a>{84}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not the rustic’s praise pass by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened his mouth and shouted “I!”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had he risked his mouth to ope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When slipped his jaws from off the rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like an arrow from a bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dashed upon the rocks below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus died the frog&mdash;was ever fate so dread?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the realm of shades his spirit sped.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
